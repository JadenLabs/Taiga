## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the
[Taiga Code of Conduct](https://github.com/JadenLabs/Taigablob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
By participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior

## I Have a Question

Before you ask a question, it is best to search for existing [Issues](https://github.com/JadenLabs/Taiga/issues) that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.

If you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:

-   Open an [Issue](https://github.com/JadenLabs/Taiga/issues/new).
-   Provide as much context as you can about what you're running into.
-   Provide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.

We will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.

### Reporting Bugs

#### Before Submitting a Bug Report

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.

-   Make sure that you are using the latest version.
-   Determine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions. If you are looking for support, you might want to check [this section](#i-have-a-question)).
-   To see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the [bug tracker](https://github.com/JadenLabs/Taiga/issues?q=label%3Abug).
-   Also make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue.
-   Collect information about the bug:
-   Stack trace (Traceback)
-   OS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)
-   Version of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant.
-   Possibly your input and the output
-   Can you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for Taiga, **including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality**. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.

#### Before Submitting an Enhancement

-   Make sure that you are using the latest version.
-   Perform a [search](https://github.com/JadenLabs/Taiga/issues) to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.
-   Find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset.

#### How Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/JadenLabs/Taiga/issues).

-   Use a **clear and descriptive title** for the issue to identify the suggestion.
-   Provide a **step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as many details as possible.
-   **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.
-   You may want to **include screenshots and animated GIFs** which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to. You can use [this tool](https://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and [this tool](https://github.com/colinkeenan/silentcast) or [this tool](https://github.com/GNOME/byzanz) on Linux.
-   **Explain why this enhancement would be useful** to most Taiga users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.

## Styleguides

We do not follow strict styling guides; however, we try to use conventional codeing principles and DRY approaches.

Additionally, we use the Prettier formatter with the settings in `.prettierrc`.

### Commit Messages

Use descriptive commit messages that follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification.<br>
Here are some examples:

```
